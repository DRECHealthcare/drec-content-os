# DREC Content OS

One continuously-learning content engine for DREC / 逆转医学.

This repository starts the Stage 1 build from the unified proposal:

- Thin Core: shared data model, brand kit, compliance rules, and contracts
- Publish rail: scheduler-ready publish queue
- Sense rail: metric ingestion endpoints and storage
- Human gate: review-ready assets and feedback capture
- Learning spine: outcomes + feedback tables that let the weekly loop improve

## Target Deployment

- **Supabase**: Postgres database and auth-ready storage later
- **Vercel**: web UI shell
- **Fly.io**: Python API and background jobs
- **GitHub**: source control and CI/CD

Current Supabase project details are documented in `docs/supabase.md`.

## Local Start

1. Create a Supabase project.
2. Run `supabase/schema.sql` in Supabase SQL editor.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill the values.
4. Start the API:

```bash
cd apps/api
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8080
```

5. Open `apps/web/index.html` in a browser, or deploy the repository root to Vercel.

## Current Status

Stage 1 is now a working thin-core workflow:

- Generate weekly DREC content briefs
- Draft conservative educational captions
- Run pre-publish compliance checks
- Queue and review posts with approval feedback
- Build a manual publishing handoff while Meta credentials are pending
- Record raw performance metrics, roll them into scored outcomes, and view the first learning summary

Meta auto-publishing and nightly Meta metrics ingestion are intentionally held until the Facebook Page and Instagram permissions are connected. See `NEXT.md` for the active build path.
